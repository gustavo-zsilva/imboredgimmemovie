## What have I learned from this journey? üî•

I don't remember learning so many cool things from a single project of mine.
To begin with, I've used NextJS features I have never used before (Internationalizaton: getting the user region),
I've also learned from scratch how to use GraphQL, why It's important and how to integrate with SSR and React.
I've taken a deeper look into SEO, with meta-tags, I've learned how to make accessible components with ```aria-label``` 
AND made a really cool responsive UI.
Last but not least, I tried out the new Firebase API, for the 'modularized web', and it was great.
This project took me a really long time to "finish", but it sure was a enjoyable journey.
