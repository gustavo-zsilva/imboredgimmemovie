### This is the most bizarre movie finder ever. It gets random movies every time you click, and needless to say, there can be some very peculiar ones out there (and there are!).

## What have I learned from this journey?

I don't remember learning so many cool things from a single project of mine.
To begin with, I've used NextJS features I have never used before (Internationalizaton: getting the user region),
I've also learned from scratch how to use GraphQL, why It's important and how to integrate with SSR and React.
I've taken a deeper look into SEO, with meta-tags, I've learned how to make accessible components with ```aria-label``` 
AND made a really cool responsive UI.
Last but not least, I tried out the new Firebase API, for the 'modularized web', and it was great.
This project took me a really long time to "finish", but it sure was a enjoyable journey.
